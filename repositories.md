**Note:** descriptions about a repository should probably be copied into the top of the repository's `README.md` file. Descriptions of how they interact with each other (via API calls, file data, or in-memory objects). Each project repo can have one main readme.md with a description and a TOC with links to other .md files in the repo. Example: install.md

**Note:** This .md can be rm. The info previously in the file relates more to services. If a user wants a list of repos they can get a link to them in readme.md under each github organization
