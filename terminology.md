# OpenStax Acronyms and Jargon (What do they mean?)

New here? Or even not new but were always afraid to ask what these acronyms mean? This document is for answering those questions. In order to let this document get started as quickly as possible, we are not going to attempt to make it complete, but rather let people add to it over time.

The first part of the doc is an alphabetical list of acronyms and jargon and what they stand for with a brief description. The second part of the doc is a place to list undefined acronyms that you do not know and would like a definition for. If you know the definition, just add it in the top list.
Alphabetical list of defined acronyms and jargon
- ABS: Group in India that does data-entry of faculty names for us into Salesforce

- BRI: Bill of Rights Institute. We are developing an AP US History title for Tutor with Bill of Rights Institute.  BRI is provided the content; we are providing the technology.

- CC: Concept Coach

- CMS: Content Management System, usually for websites and other information systems.

- CNX: The OpenStax CNX website where all modular educational materials hosted by OpenStax reside.  These modules are used as the source for all OpenStax textbooks, and generally correspond to a section with a chapter of the book.

- COB: Close Of Business


- CPT: Content Production Tools: This product suite is used by OpenStax Content Managers and external XML (or for assessments, HTML) teams to transform manuscripts into XML or HTML.  Once the XML/HTML is on our platform -- cnx.org or exercises.openstax.org - we can create PDFs and other formats of the textbooks.

- CRMS: Our customer relationship management system/database that allows us to keep accurate records on every person, largely faculty member, who is using or has expressed interest in using anything OpenStax, except OpenStax CNX. CNX users are not tracked in SF.

- CS: The customer service team. Their formal name is Support, or Support team.

- CTE: Consistent Textbook Experience: Faculty and students use textbooks simultaneously in multiple formats (print, PDF, mobile, web). The Textbook Experience is a suite of textbook formats and has its own product manager to guide the development and use of these formats together in a coherent way. Consistent Textbook Experience is a project to make web versions, PDF and print versions, and eventually mobile versions of the textbooks work well together for faculty and students. Currently they work poorly together because the numbering and location of assessments, glossary entries, etc. is significantly different between the different formats.

- GORILLA: "Why Gorilla in the OpenStax All (Searchword Gorilla) folder?" -- Kathi needed a way to find this folder in Google Docs and so she picked a word that does NOT appear in her google docs that she could search on. Might work for you also. Apologies if you are a docent for the gorillas in the zoo and have a zillion docs with the word gorilla in them.

- LTI (in the context of Tutor LMS integration): learning tools interoperability, major standard about how learning tools work together.

- Pardot: The service we use to send emails. It’s owned by Salesforce (see below) and uses data from Salesforce to create custom email campaigns.

- PDM: Product Manager. What is a product manager?

- PIP: Partner in Publishing. This is our external contracted sales team, which calls faculty and asks them to adopt OpenStax.

- SF: Salesforce, our CRMS.  Also abbreviated, SFDC (Salesforce.com)

- SOW: Statement of work

- SPARFA: Sparse Factor Analysis. An algorithm developed by Drew, Mr. Lan, and richb. Used in Tutor to estimate student knowledge states, among other things.  

- TEA: Texas Education Agency.  Through the Texas legislature, OpenStax was awarded funding to create the following books for the TEA: AP Physics (I and II), AP Bio, HS Physics, HS Statistics, AP Macroeconomics, AP Microeconomics.

- TEG: Trinity Education Group.  This is the group that developed the Texas Gateway for the TEA.  OpenStax’s books for the TEA will be hosted on the Texas Gateway.

- Triple-C: A project and channel comprising three related subjects. CTE (Consistent Textbook Experience), CPT (Content Production Tools), and CNX (Connexions). These three are grouped together because they have one project manager and a common group of developers working on them. Each also has a product manager (for a total of three product managers). Each product manager (PDM) represents the experience and products used by a different audience. The CTE PDM  (Alana) represents faculty and students using the textbooks in multiple formats. The CPT PDM (Alina) represents the Content Managers using a suite of tools for experts to produce OpenStax content (textbooks and assessments). The CNX PDM (Ed) represents all of the users of the CNX website.

- Wagtail: The CMS used on openstax.org. (See CMS above)

- WIP: Work in progress. Used for documents and code that is not yet in a final state and expected to change soon and rapidly.
