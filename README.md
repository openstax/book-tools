# What is this?

This repository acts as a Wiki for learning more about the book tools projects.

Check the individual `.md` files in here to find out about terminology, URL structure, etc.

Since it is not a "code" respository it is a bit more lax in terms of Pull Requests, Code Review, Travis, etc.
