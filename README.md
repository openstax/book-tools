Since it is not a "code" respository it is a bit more lax in terms of Pull Requests, Code Review, Travis, etc.

As knowledge is added, a directory structure may emerge; especially for folks that want to just jot down notes and stuff (as a `book-tools` specific [napkin-notes](https://github.com/openstax/napkin-notes)).
