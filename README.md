# What is this?

This repository acts as a Wiki for learning more about the book tools projects.

Check the individual `.md` files in here to find out about terminology, URL structure, etc.

- [Repositories and Services](./repositories.md)

Since it is not a "code" respository it is a bit more lax in terms of Pull Requests, Code Review, Travis, etc. 

As knowledge is added, a directory structure may emerge; especially for folks that want to just jot down notes and stuff (as a `book-tools` specific [napkin-notes](https://github.com/openstax/napkin-notes)).
